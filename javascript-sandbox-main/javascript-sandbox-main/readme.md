# JavaScript Sandbox

This is all of the code from my Modern JS From The Beginning course. It contains all of the learning modules and project code.

The `Shopping List`, `Flixx`, `Tracalorie`, `Tracalorie-webpack`, and `Random Ideas` projects have the final code in a zip file in that section. There are also incremental folders for each video.

## The Starter Files

There is a folder called "javascript-sandbox-start", which contains the same file structure, only without the JavaScript. You can use these to follow along with the course or create your own files as you go. The main projects are not included in the starter files.

## Premium Docs

The premium markdown files with all code samples and explanation are included with the premium course at [https://traversymedia.com](https://traversymedia.com/)
